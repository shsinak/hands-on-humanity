        <h2>General Information</h2>
        <p>Yemen, located at the southern end of the Arabian Peninsula, boasts a rich history that spans over three millennia. Its strategic position made it a hub for ancient civilizations such as the Sabaeans, Minaeans, and Himyarites, who thrived on the lucrative spice trade. The region is often associated with the legendary Queen of Sheba and was referred to by the Romans as "Arabia Felix," meaning "Fertile Arabia" or "Happy Arabia," due to its prosperity.</p>
        <p>In the 7th century, Yemen embraced Islam, integrating into the broader Islamic world. The modern Republic of Yemen was established in May 1990, unifying the Yemen Arab Republic (North Yemen) and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (South Yemen).</p>
        <p>Since 2015, Yemen has been engulfed in a devastating conflict that has precipitated one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. As of recent estimates, approximately <strong>21.6 million people—two-thirds of the population</strong>—are in dire need of humanitarian assistance. The conflict has displaced over <strong>4.5 million</strong> individuals, many multiple times, exacerbating their vulnerability. The war has also led to severe food insecurity, with more than <strong>17 million</strong> people experiencing acute hunger.</p>
        <p>The situation has been further complicated by regional dynamics. Israeli military actions have extended into Yemen, targeting areas associated with Houthi rebels. For instance, Israeli airstrikes have hit multiple locations in Yemen, leading to Houthi retaliations with missiles and drones aimed at Israel, which were intercepted. These developments have heightened regional tensions and added complexity to Yemen's internal conflict.</p>
