            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) is a global Palestinian-led initiative that advocates for freedom, justice, and equality by promoting various forms of boycott against Israel until it complies with international law and human rights standards.</p>
				<p>Israel's actions, including the occupation and colonization of Palestinian land, the discrimination against Palestinian citizens within Israel, and the denial of the right of return for Palestinian refugees, are central to the BDS cause. Inspired by the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, BDS calls for global action to hold Israel accountable and to push for adherence to international law.</p>
				<p>Since its establishment in 2005, BDS has grown into a powerful global movement, bringing together unions, academic associations, churches, and grassroots groups around the world. Its efforts are having a significant impact, challenging international support for Israel's apartheid policies and settler-colonialism.

</p>
				<p>The ongoing injustice faced by Palestinians dates back to 1948, with Israel continuing to violate their fundamental rights while evading international accountability. This system of settler-colonialism, apartheid, and occupation is supported by international actors, including governments, corporations, and institutions that assist in the oppression of Palestinians.</p>
				<p>As those in power refuse to intervene, Palestinian civil society has called for a collective global response in solidarity with the Palestinian struggle for freedom, justice, and equality. The BDS movement represents the Palestinian popular and civil society consensus, focusing on grassroots initiatives for boycotting, academic and cultural boycotts, and efforts to fight normalization in various sectors.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
				<p>Fifteen years after its launch on 9 July 2005, the BDS movement for Palestinian rights enters a new era. It is more urgent than ever as Israel intensifies its gradual ethnic cleansing of the Indigenous Palestinians, choking us in ever-shrinking Bantustans.

</p>
				<p>As a result of the BDS movement for Palestinian rights growing into one of the most influential global justice movements over the past 15 years, BDS has aimed to enhance its effectiveness, embrace intersectionality, and expand its global reach by on June 22nd, 2020, it released "BDS@15: Fifteen Ways To Support Our Struggle For Freedom, Justice & Equality."</p>
                <p>You can support BDS by advocating for policies that align with human rights, encouraging organizations to divest from companies supporting the occupation, and amplifying the voices of marginalized communities.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>The Palestinian BDS National Committee (BNC), the largest coalition leading the global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, asserts that the most impactful form of solidarity with the Palestinian people is to end the complicity of states, corporations, and institutions in Israel's ongoing human rights violations against 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza. This includes holding accountable those involved in Israel’s apartheid regime and settler-colonialism, which has persisted for 76 years.</p>
				<p>Corporations supporting Israel's unlawful occupation, racial segregation, and apartheid – both within and outside the occupied Palestinian territories – are complicit in these international crimes. These companies, through their military, logistical, financial, intelligence, and infrastructure support to Israel, must be held responsible. The BDS movement’s Corporate Complicity Criteria outline the specific forms of complicity. For more details on these corporations, visit the full list <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/Guide-to-BDS-Boycott" target="_blank">here</a>
