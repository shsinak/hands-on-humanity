        <h2>What is Mental Health?</h2>
        <p>Mental health refers to emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how people think, feel, and act, and determines how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices.</p>
		<p>Mental health is just as important as physical health—yet it's often overlooked or misunderstood.</p>
		<p>Mental health conditions can range from common issues like anxiety and depression to more severe disorders such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. They can affect anyone—regardless of age, background, or circumstance.</p>
        <div class="mental-health-fact">
        <p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong></em><br>
        Approximately <strong>1 in 5 adults in the U.S.</strong> experience mental illness each year — that’s <strong>59.3 million people</strong> in 2022, or <strong>23.1%</strong> of the adult population.

	</div>
		<p>When mental health struggles go untreated, they can affect physical health, relationships, education, and employment. However, with the right support and resources, recovery is possible, and people can lead fulfilling lives.</p>
		<p>Taking care of your mental health isn’t a luxury—it’s a necessity. That’s why it’s important to break the stigma, talk openly, and seek help when needed.</p>
